# Assignment
# The aim of the assignment
The project uses neural networks and random forest algorithms to form a model. In addition, the SNES algorithm is used to evolve strategies. Neural networks are used to extract features from the data and continue to perform two different tasks in a random forest. The first random forest is used for classification, and the second is used for mapping.

# Data
We have shared 3 data sets, MNIST, MNIST-M and Office31.
- The MNIST-M data comes from:https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/resources.html#bsds500
- Office31 data comes from(you need to download this one):https://pan.baidu.com/s/1o8igXT4#list/path=%2F

# The steps
- Running the create_mnistm.ipynb and creating a mnistm_data.pkl.plk file, I didn't upload the mnistm_data.pkl.plk because the mnistm_data.pkl.plk file is too large to upload. 
- Running the mnist_snes_test.ipynb, which is used to test the MNIST-M data. This process takes a long time to wait. 
- Running three files. webcom_dslr.ipynb, dslr_webcom.ipynb, amazon_webcom.ipynb.The three files have the same code but use different data. xx-xxx means the former(xx) is the source domain and the latter(xxx) is the target domain.
